# SmilecdrCodingChallenge

This Angualr project was done as a coding challenge for Smile CDR.

It queries patient data from their test server and outputs the information unto a table. 

Patients are sorted by name. Patients can also be searched for.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.
